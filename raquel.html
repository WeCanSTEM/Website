    <h2 id="particle">Introduction</h2>
		<p id="particle">
      For this article, we have decided to take a different writing approach. We asked Raquel to discuss her High School career, College career, and her current work career.<br>
<br>
    "My name is Raquel. I from Brazil where I earned a doctoral degree in Food Science at the
University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Currently, I am doing my postdoctoral at Georgetown
University Medical Center, Lombardi Cancer Center. Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center is
one of only 41 institutions in the nation designated by the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center
and is the only comprehensive cancer center in the Washington, DC area. Lombardi
Comprehensive Cancer Center is comprised of 4 research programs: Cancer Prevention and
Control Program, Experimental Therapeutics, Molecular Oncology, and Breast Cancer."<br>

<br>

"Throughout my research experiences, I was given hands-on in vitro (cell culture) and in vivo
(mouse) experiments to study cancer biology, molecular biology techniques such as gene
expression analysis through PCR, including primer design, RNA extraction, evaluation of RNA
quality; DNA methylation analysis, including DNA extraction; Western blot, including protein
extraction and quantification. Also, I worked in collaboration with many graduate students
assisting them in their project design and supervised undergraduate students. Part of my
responsibilities included designing and scheduling a project plan for these students to execute. In
addition, I have done volunteer at the Washington English Center school, where I have
accomplished one hour per day teaching English as a foreign language to help underrepresented
minorities and promoting diversity, inclusion, and equity efforts to support international students."
    </p>
<h2 id="particle">High School</h2>
<p id="particle">
  "Science has been one of my passions for as long as I can remember. Science is about life and
give to us a systematic way of understanding the life of millions of things around the world. I
just wanted to watch and know about many different forms of life on Earth. Also, the
introduction to the laboratory environment during high school consolidated my interest in the
STEM career and set me off to become a Biologist. Furthermore, even in high school, taking jazz
and ballet classes became purifying for me because the dance classes help me express myself and
improve my well-being. Through dance classes, I developed the ability to concentrate intensely,
listen introspectively, solve problems creatively, collaboratively develop a project, and maintain
composure when faced with unexpected. Dance presentation let me have visibility and this
visibility help me engage in a community. The dance flourished many helpful skills to the
science career path, such as self-discipline, patience, perseverance, flexibility, teamwork, and be
prepared to face the anxiety of routine or rejections."
  </p>
<h2 id="particle">College</h2>
  <p id="particle">
    "To get in a scientific career I started the course of Biology in an institution based on
philanthropic doctrines. The University has a mission to promote the development of its students,
transmitting values such as Ethics and humanization. Most of the courses are structured in two
axes – a) the specific, which is made up of subjects exclusively to the training area; b) the
interprofessional one, made up of classes common to the different areas of training, subdivided
into exact sciences, human and social, and biological sciences (health). I attended the University
because I was awarded a full scholarship to pursue my bachelor’s degree in Biology. Be awarded

a full scholarship helped me remove financial barriers to earn a college and become an
independent and international researcher in the non-genetic inheritance of cancer predisposition.
The Plant Physiology, a subdiscipline of botany, was one of the toughest courses I have ever
taken. I will never forget. I tried to record the lecture, but the test was too short no multiple
choice. It was hurtful. However, cell biology, anatomy and physiology, and immunology were
the most important and favorite classes. These classes helped me in my career path and personal
life. Losing my aunt to esophageal cancer was the first time I faced an incurable disease. Two
years later, my cousin was diagnosed with breast cancer at a younger age. Then, I just wanted to
understand everything about everything cancer-related. Not beyond, I started my first internships
in cancer research, where I was involved in a joint research project on the effect of an adequate
nutritional therapy could attenuate inflammatory mediators after surgical trauma, which is a
critical step for avoiding post-operative immune dysfunction and multiple organ failure. In my
second internship, I worked with the development of drugs also known as growth factor. This has
been used after chemotherapy to help patient white blood cells recover after treatment.
I would say to the next generation, pursue a career that brings life, passion, and happiness. If you
choose a career in STEM, pursue your dreams, and do not give up."

<h2 id="particle">Current Job</h2>
    <p id="particle">
      "The laboratory I have been working on having a collaborative environment. I enjoy the fact that I
have a great degree of freedom to produce high-quality work and results. I love the challenges
the job provides as most projects require a problem-solving approach, promote the dissemination
of scientific content. Further, I enjoy meeting a wide variety of students. And, I love how my
supervisor constantly believes in me, and how she cares about me and my professional
development."
      </p>
<h2 id="particle">Projects she has worked on</h2>
<p id="particle">
  "My current work makes me look back at things that most of my teachers and colleagues did not
entirely agree, like the environment giving rise to changes in organisms during their lifetime and
could be transmitted to their offspring through germline from Mister Jean Baptiste Lamarck, but
I thought as an interesting and amusing aspect of evolution. Afterward, I met my Ph.D.
supervisor and heard from him about how maternal diet could affect the offspring breast cancer
risk. I remembered that I could not stop thinking about this topic. How amazing it is. Then,
epigenetics came into my life and I started to study more about evolution and life itself. It was a
wonderful new world of possibilities. Then, I started to study whether maternal diet influences
the offspring&#39;s health outcome. When I started my postdoctoral training, I was invited to study
the father's side. So I began to study more and saw that few people were starting to question
themselves about that, and I decided to join them. That is how I ended up studying how paternal
nutritional status or lifestyle at conception time can influence female offspring susceptibility to
breast cancer."
  </p>
  <h2 id="particle">What she hopes to accomplish in the future</h2>
  <p id="particle">
    "I want to understand the intricate details of life and help humans understand that take care of
themselves properly is important to have quality of life and stay healthy."<br>
</p>
<h2 id="particle">Why she loves her jobs in STEM</h2>
<p id="particle">
  I enjoy the freedom and autonomy to develop my ideas for projects, write grants, learn new and
sophisticated techniques, the excitement to finish the project and submit the paper.
