            Eva is a cellular and molecular biologist who will be attending Columbia University
        for a Ph.D. in Cellular, Molecular, and Biomedical studies with a specialization in cell biology. She currently volunteers as a tutor to help students in college.<br>
        <br>
        In High School, Eva was the yearbook editor in chief and the dance head for a school production. She volunteered at an international organization that promoted inclusion and friendly environments for disabled children and adults. Eva also participated in a summer volunteer program that traveled to retirement communities, children's hospitals, and orphanages. Duties of this included preparing and distributing meals, organizing games, and entertainment, providing companionship to those in need. Finally, Eva was the student head of an organization that trained high school students to become leaders and make positive changes in schools and communities. Her Favorite subjects were honors biology along with AP biology, she also said that these we're the subjects she found to be most helpful to her now. One tip of advice Eva would like to share for current high school students is, "form close relationships with teachers- you can learn a lot from them and they will be writing college recs for you!"<br>
        <br>
        In College, Eva is the vice president for an organization that educates and fundraises for breast/ovarian cancer support. Eva says that the classes that have helped her the most throughout her college career have been cell biology, virology, microbiology, genetics, guided research, and seminar (thesis). Her favorite classes are cell biology, virology, microbiology, the medical imaginary (medical anthropology course), and Spanish. The classes that have been the most challenging are cell biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry. A tip for college students that Eva had was "GO TO OFFICE HOURS! You will learn topics for tests that weren’t mentioned in class, and professors will like you because they recognize you (recs!!)"<br>
        <br>
        Eva is currently working towards obtaining her Ph.D. in Cellular, Molecular, and Biomedical Sciences with a specialization in Cell Biology at Columbia University. When asked what a typical day looked like she said that usually, she can be found, " reading papers, emailing PIs and current students, zoom meetings, looking up PIs." Her favorite project that she has worked on so far in her career has been her undergraduate project; "biogenesis of bc1 complex in mitochondria in Saccharomyces cerevisiae." She says that this position has helped her grow because she has "Spent 1.5 years in this lab so I was able to see through a project from start to finish and confirm my commitment to medical research. I completed a thesis on my research and presented at two poster symposia on this project, which allowed me to consolidate my extensive, detailed work into one idea with a central question and answer. In addition, presenting my scientific ideas to an audience gave me a sense of mastery over my research and further motivated me to pursue a future in science." She says that she keeps wanting to come back everyday because of her "interest in oncology stems from the loss of my maternal grandmother to ovarian cancer at a young age, long before I was born, leaving a gaping imprint on my family. Hearing stories about her vibrant, promising life cut short left me determined to ensure that no other family would suffer the consequences of this tragedy. I feel at home at the bench and I love the everyday work and am always excited to learn more!" Eva also said that her PI's passion for science really inspires her, "he’s in his 80s and still works at the bench every day! He is extremely generous and is always sharing his supplies and cell lines with other labs. My mentor is also incredible, caring, helpful, and has become an amazing friend to me! She is a joy to spend all day with." She loves her job in STEM because she has a "deeply rooted love for biology, both in the intricate processes, such as understanding the underlying mechanisms of a molecular pathway, as well as the big picture, like how targeting aberrant proteins in that pathway can improve health outcomes for patients. I know my work is important and will keep working to make a difference in the medical field." In her free time, Eva enjoys pure barre, swimming, reading, painting, organizing, spending time with friends and family!<br></p>
